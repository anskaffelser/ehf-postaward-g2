The intention of this BIS is the synchronization of the Punch Out catalogue information between the selling and the buying side in a business relationship, where the selling side is the source of the information and the buying side the receiver. In this BIS, the selling side can be any Economic Operator and the buying side any Contracting Authority. The intended scope for this BIS includes business-to-government (B2G) and business-to-business (B2B) relationships.  Although this BIS is a basis for an EDI agreement between two parties, it does not address all business level details of such an agreement. It is the provider's responsibility that data contained in the shopping cart transaction is valid from a technical, as well as a business point of view.

The transaction, specified in this BIS are intended to be exchanged between the procurement systems of contracting authorities and systems for shopping cart transactions of economic operators. This document recognizes that when using Punch Out it is common to use synchronous message transfer methods but technical specification of that including the login- and logout transactions are outside scope of this BIS.

In this BIS, synchronization of shopping cart transaction information covers the submission of new information, no update or deletion of information is covered by this BIS. In case of an update/change, the buyer will simply generate a new product- or service list by repeating the process.

The information sourced with the Punch Out BIS may be used in following business process, such as ordering. The order transaction is outside scope of this BIS, we then refer to BISs PEPPOL BIS 3A Order Only or PEPPOL BIS 28A Ordering.
