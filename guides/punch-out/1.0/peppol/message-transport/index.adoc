= Message transport

The transactions defined in this BISs need to be transferred from the sending party to the receiving party through an agreed transport network and protocol. The PEPPOL BIS is specified independent of a transport network but it is designed with the requirement of the PEPPOL network in mind and does not specifically support other transport network that may be used.


== The PEPPOL network

The PEPPOL transport network is a four corner transport network that allows senders end receivers to exchange messages from one service provider to another by using a single identifier for the parties. Details about the PEPPOL network can be found at [PEPPOL_Transp].



==	Synchronous message transfer


It is recognized that the use of Punch Out often requires synchronous methods for retrieving that data directly from the sellers shopping cart into the buyers purchasing system. Several methods are available including the following:

* Direct database connections with HTTP using database interface specifications.
* File download using Wget, HTTP, FTP or similar technology.

The following clauses only briefly introduce these transfer mechanism. Analysis of what is the most suitable methods and technical specification are not in scope for this BIS and are not provided by PEPPOL.

=== Direct HTTP database connections

Direct database connection using HTTP are common when retrieving shopping carts. Most commonly these methods retrieve the data directly from the catalogue in structured format using input names as field identifiers. In order to read the data correctly into the buyer's database its structure must be clearly defined.

This PEPPOL BIS provides a detailed structure of the shopping cart data, using UBL XML and detailed semantic specifications and rules. Such an XML message can be retrieved as payload with an HTTP connection. Once that XML file has been retrieved and saved it can be processes in the same way as an XML file that has been delivered, e.g., through the PEPPOL network.

A profile for such a message transfer is specified in the document "PEPPOL synchronous message transfer protocol" provided by OpenPEPPOL and may be used to transfer Punch Out messages.


=== Internet file transfer

Since the data of the shopping cart generated by using this Punch Out BIS is captured into a single structured XML file, it lends itself to normal file transfer over the Internet. Such a file transfer can be done with several methods including.


* File Transfer Protocol (FTP).
* Wget over FTP or HTTP.
