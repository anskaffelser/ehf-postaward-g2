== Introduction

This document describes the new version of EHF Invoice and Credit Note, now renamed to EHF Billing to align with naming in OpenPEPPOL.

EHF Billing is the implementation of link:https://standards.cen.eu/dyn/www/f?p=204:110:0::::FSP_PROJECT,FSP_ORG_ID:60602,1883209&cs=104E4C4FA3744A8DEA8E98A7B500306FD[EN 16931 Electronic invoicing] according to link:http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32014L0055&from=EN[EU Directive 2014/55/EU] for the Norwegian market.


== Implementation

OpenPEPPOL has created link:https://peppol.eu/peppol-bis-billing-3-0/[PEPPOL BIS Billing 3.0], a Core Invoice Usage Specification (CIUS) as implementation of EN 16931, for cross border using in PEPPOL. The new PEPPOL BIS Billing 3.0 support inclusion of national rules based on origin country of seller.

Based on work done in PEPPOL BIS Billing 3.0, Difi has included Norwegian rules in PEPPOL BIS Billing 3.0 and does not see a need to implement a different CIUS targeting the Norwegian market. Implementation of EHF Billing 3.0 is therefore done by implementing PEPPOL BIS Billing 3.0 without extensions or extra rules.
